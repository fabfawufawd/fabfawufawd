### ✨ About Me
I'm a Middle Python Developer with a strong focus on automation. My expertise lies in developing bots for various applications, including game automation and Discord bots. I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating efficient solutions.

I work primarily with Python and have a solid background in scripting, web scraping, and API integrations. Outside of coding, I’m an avid Linux user and run Arch Linux with the Hyprland window manager.
